-----Setup------

Modules required;
$ module load dev
$ module load libs
$ module load libs gsl/intel/2.3
$ module load dev intel/2017-u3
(To quickly load these modules just type 'source source_me' (don't include the quotation marks))

Compile command;
$ icc -o run main.cpp density.cpp functions.cpp random.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -qopenmp

To execute the code;
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2; ./run
(Set OMP_NUM_THREADS equal to however many threads you want to use)
("run" is the name of the executable. i.e: whatever word you put after '-o' in the compile command)
